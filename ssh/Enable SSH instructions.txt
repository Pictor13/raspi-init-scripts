1. `sudo raspi-config` (or from HomeMenu->Preferences->RaspberryPiConfiguration)
- chose Interfaces
- enable SSH

1a. (optional) it is recommended to change default password for user Pi
- `sudo passwd`

2. To enable access by typing password:
- `sudo /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
- `PasswordAuthentication yes`
- `ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes`

3. (optional) Enable access via openssl private key
- generate RSA key on client (`id_rsa.pub`)
- still on the client, copy it to the RasPi ssh-server via
`scp $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@raspberrypi:/home/pi/myHomeComputer.id_rsa.pub`

3a. on the server (RasPi), add the key to the local `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`,
via GUI text editor or via shell with
- `touch /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- `cat /home/pi/myHomeComputer.id_rsa.pub >> /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys`

4. From the client, connect to the RasPi via SSH
- `ssh pi@raspberrypi`

NOTEs:
- if you copied your machine's public key then you'll get logged in automatically
- if you enabled the config options then you'll get asked the password for user `pi`
- if `raspberrypi` hostname doesn't resolve (try also `raspberrypi.local`)
you can obtain the IP address via `nmap raspberrypi` (might be necessary to install it
on the client machine)
